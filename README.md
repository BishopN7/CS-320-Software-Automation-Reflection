# CS-320-Software-Automation-Reflection
This repository will encompass primarily the ContactService milestone, as well as my reflections report being included. 

**Questions**

**1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I like to ensure that I do not have bias, when it comes to verifying that all is functional. That means
having a testing strategy that enforces the security of the code. I utilized unit testing to validate
each and every class in the requirements. The use of JUnit tests was a necessity, because it checked every 
input that was both valid and invalid. In terms of data, my coverage percentages for not just my ContactService, but
other two milestones were roughly 80%. By criteria, this was the goal to reach, so that each milestone would be robust
and functional. 

The validation logic in my code made it possible to prevent any data that is not accepted by the program. In addition, to 
exception-based testing, it rejected improper values to keep inputs within the constraints. By writing code, that is predictable
and defensive, it makes code readable and scalable to be managed. 

**2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Interpreting the needs of users comes by understanding the requirements given in the design plan. Having a well-thought out
plan, can help developers decide what features are neccessary. From there, said requirements can be translated into rules within
a program. Usually, documentation by the use of comments, can help to track what requirements are being met before deployment. I was able
to create generic scenarios for each of my testing methods. These instances helped give an idea, of how the ContactService program will execute, 
when given either valid or invalid inputs. 

**3. How do I approach designing software?**
My approach to designing software stems from comprehending what users want in a product that can benefit them. I do not like to dive deep 
into a project, without proper consultation if I am in a group. Additionally, I prefer my code to be grounded in modularity, clarity, and
the ability to be properly tested with minimal errors. From there, I create service method within different classes to test and manage various
objects to achieve the desired goal. Plus, from learning about testing, it gave me a new scope how to better proceed with early coding stages.
